Telco Customer Churn Prediction
================
> Understanding telco customer behavior to predict whether they will churn or not


### Introduction

According to [this article](https://www.bizjournals.com/albany/news/2019/04/11/number-of-businesses-in-the-united-states.html#:~:text=But%20with%20more%20than%2032.5,to%20where%20people%20conduct%20business.), there are "more than 32.5 million businesses in the world". No one can doubt that the key to success for businesses is to have a more solid and wider customer base. Therefore, their main interest is to have a better customer service for their existing and future customers. And this is absolutely more important to telecom companies such as AT&T and Verizon, because the market is already saturated. Hence, they should first retain their customers not to lose to their competitors. To do so, they should understand customer behavior. 

The goal of this project is to predict whether a Telco customer will churn or not. Before building a model, I cleaned the dataset to easily explore the dataset and visualized it. Then I built a logistic regression model for classification. 

This is part of a group project where we introduce the concept of logistic regression and how logistic regression can be used in practice. This group is comprised of five graduate students. Our group made this [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGmy0B-4mUItp8wku-Mil8iBGIp1u0JIV) for the project. I was in charge of data cleaning, EDA, and model building.
